Welcome to the Brain Games!

There are 5 games available for you. It is up to you what game to play.
1. "Definition of an even number" (brain-even)
2. "Simple calculator" (brain-calc)
3. "Determination of the greatest common divisor" (brain-gcd)
4. "Arithmetic progression" (brain-progression)
5. "Definition of a prime number" (brain-prime)

Launch any game you want and follow instructions. Break a leg!
